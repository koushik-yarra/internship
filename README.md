# Supermarket Sales Data Analysis

This project is an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of a supermarket sales dataset. The main objective is to analyze and understand the sales patterns, customer behaviors, and product performance based on the available transactional data.

## Contents

- `Exploratory_data_analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing all the data analysis steps and results.
- `sales.csv`: The dataset used for analysis (not included here if not public).

## What I Have Done

1. **Data Loading and Basic Exploration:**
   - Imported the sales data using pandas.
   - Inspected the first few records to understand the structure and content of the dataset.
   - Checked the shape of the data, confirming 1000 rows and 17 columns.

2. **Data Cleaning:**
   - Verified that there are no missing values in any columns.
   - Checked for duplicate records and confirmed there are none.
   - Used `info()` to inspect data types and ensure consistency.

3. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Converted date and time columns to appropriate datetime formats.
   - Handled potential inconsistencies in time formatting.

4. **Descriptive Statistics:**
   - Generated summary statistics for numerical columns (mean, min, max, std, etc.).
   - Explored the distribution of sales, taxes, quantities, ratings, and other key metrics.

5. **(Planned/Optional) Further Analysis:**
   - The notebook is ready for further steps such as data visualization, trend analysis, and deeper insights into customer types, product lines, branches, and payment methods.

## Technologies Used

- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization (setup in notebook)
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

## Summary

This project provides a solid foundation for understanding supermarket sales data. The notebook is organized with clean, reproducible steps for anyone who wants to continue the analysis, visualize the data, or build predictive models based on this dataset.
